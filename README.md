# Trust implemented using Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) and the Semantic Web (JSON-LD)
## Abstract
This repository contains the *Handbook* of all the concepts, ideas, clarifications, information and models that I've gathered, created, and designed during the last 3 years focused on these topics. The main purpose of making this handbook is to provide easy-to-read explanations, guidelines and solutions based on my personal knowledge, experience and opinion. The most challenging task I decided to address here is trying to **lower the technical barriers** to enter this world, which is one of the most demanding in terms of technical knowledge.
